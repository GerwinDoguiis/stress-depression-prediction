This project leverages machine learning to predict and analyze student stress levels using psychological, academic, and lifestyle factors. Through data preprocessing, feature selection, and advanced models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost optimized with Bayesian techniques, the system identifies key stress indicators and classifies students into low, medium, or high stress categories. In addition, the project extends to predicting a studentâ€™s PHQ-9 score based on survey responses, providing deeper insights into depression risk. The findings highlight the most influential factors affecting student well-being and can guide interventions to improve mental health support.
